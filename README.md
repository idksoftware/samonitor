# SAMonitor
SAMonitor is a Simple Availability Monitoring tool. This tool enables anyone with the necessary permissions to monitor servers and the network applications they host for failures, recoveries and load. Minimize downtime by configuring the software to notify your on-call system personal when a critical machine or application fails.

- Can you track trends in up-time availability?
- Are you alerted when problems happen?
- Monitor that your services responding correctly?

SAMonitor is a robust system where a number of monitoring stations can be deployed. In the event of the station itself stopping, due to a possible hardware failure or maintenance of the server the monitor is running, other stations will automatically take over the task of monitoring with the minimum of loss of monitoring cover.

SAMonitor is cross-platform, targeting Windows, Mac and Unix OSâ€™s so can be deployed any ware required in the network.
